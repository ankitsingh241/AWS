              
   This is our first lab of Elastic Block Store.
    
   We will learn how to create a Amazon Machine Image from EC2 and use it to make another EC2 in different Region in AWS.

   Login to your AWS Management console, go to EC2.

   
   Step 1 : Create a Windows Webserver and make some random file in it.
   
   Step 2 : Click on Windows instance --> Actions --> Image --> create Image
            Image name --> Description --> create image.

   Step 3 : Go to AMIs, you will see a Image has created.
            Now go to instance and delete the windows instance.

   Step 4 : Now go to AMI --> Actions --> copy AMI
            Destination region(choose any) Tokyo --> Copy AMI.
            

   Step 5 : Change the region and you will see a image in that AMIs.

   Step 6 : We will create a instance with the help of this image in this region.
            Once image is available we will make a instance.

   Step 7 : Click on the AMI --> Launch instance from AMI
            Same process to launch instance and launch.
   
   Step 8 : Connect --> but during connections if rdp ask for password enter the old one
            which has been used before making image.
 
   Step 9 : Once server connected you will see the random files that you have created will be as it is.
           

   Till now you have created an instance in different region using image of another instance in another region.
