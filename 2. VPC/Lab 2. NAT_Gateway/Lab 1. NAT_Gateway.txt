              
   This is our Second lab.
    
   We will see how a NAT Gateway works in AWS.

   First we have to create a VPC and in that two subnets one Privet and one Public.
   We will create EC2 in both subnets.
   Only Public instance will be connected to Internet gateway not Privet.
   
   Login to your AWS Management console, go to VPC.

   
   Step 1 : VPC
            
            Create VPC --> VPC only --> Name(vpc1)
            -->IPv4 CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
   
   Step 2 : SUBNET

            Now we will create two subnets for this vpc.
            I). Public Subnet
            II).Private Subnet

            Create subnet --> VPC ID(Select your VPC(vpc1)) 
            --> Name(Public/Private) --> Availability Zone(AZ) select any
            --> IPv4 CIDR 10.0.0.0/24(Public) - 10.0.1.0/24(Private)

   Step 3 : INTERNET GATEWAY

            Create internet gateway --> Name(IGW1)
            Now the status will be detached, to attach it.
            Click on it --> Actions --> Attach to VPC
            Select your VPC and attach.

   Step 4 : ROUTE TABLE

            Create two route table one for pulic and one for private.

            Click on it --> Subnet Associations --> Edit subnet associations
            --> select your subnet --> Save

            Do it for both, add public route with public subnet and
            add private route with private subnet.

            For Public : Routes --> Edit --> Add route --> 0.0.0.0/0 --> Internet Gateway --> Save

            
   We will create two Windows Instance for two subnets.
    
   Step 5 : Name --> Windows AMI --> t2.micro --> New key pair
            --> Edit Network Settings --> Select your created VPC insted of default one
            --> Select subnet(Public/Private) --> Auto-assign public IP ENABLE for public and DISABLE for private 
            --> rdp-anywhere; http-anywhere; https-anywhere --> Launch
  
   Connect to Server using RDP.

   Now in that Windows instance go to Remote Desktop Connection.
   Paste the Private IP from Private instance.
   User name - Administrator
   Passowrd - Decrypted password
   
   Now a Private instance has been looged in to a Public Instance.
   Since Private instance has no access to internet but Public instance has 
   and through VPC both can be connected or talk to each other.

   Now, go to CMD and ping 8.8.8.8 but you will see request timed out.

   Go to VPC again again and create a NAT Gateway and select Public Subnet.

   Now go again to Private route table edit route and add 0.0.0.0/0 NAT gateway.
   Private Routes --> Edit --> Add route --> 0.0.0.0/0 --> NAT Gateway --> Save

   Once NAT Gateway active you will get reply in ping test and that will show Private instance is connected to internet.

   So again, function of NAT gateway: When two subnet is created in a VPC one has internet access(public)
                                      and other(private) has not, NAT let these two subnets talk to each other 
                                      or NAT helps private subnet to get connected with internet through public subnet.
