              
   This is our first lab.
    
   We will create a Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) in AWS.

   Login to your AWS Management console, go to VPC.

   To create and run successfully a VPC we need to follow these process:

   1. VPC
   2. Subnet
   3. Internet Gateway
   4. Routing table

   
   Step 1 : VPC
            
            Create VPC --> VPC only --> Name(myVPC)
            -->IPv4 CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
   
   Step 2 : SUBNET

            Create subnet --> VPC ID(Select your VPC(myVPC)) 
            --> Name(mySubnet) --> Availability Zone(AZ) select any
            --> IPv4 CIDR 10.0.0.0/24

   Step 3 : INTERNET GATEWAY

            Create internet gateway --> Name(myIGW)
            Now the status will be detached, to attach it.
            Click on it --> Actions --> Attach to VPC
            Select your VPC and attach.

   Step 4 : ROUTE TABLE

            Create a route table with your VPC.

            Click on it --> Subnet Associations --> Edit subnet associations
            --> select your subnet --> Save

            Routes --> Edit --> Add route --> 0.0.0.0/0 --> Internet Gateway --> Save

   Now you have created a VPC, now check if it works or not.
   To check it wheather its working or not we need to make a instance and run it.
   We will create a Windows Instance.
    
   Step 5 : Name(VPC Testing) --> Windows AMI --> t2.micro --> New key pair
            --> Edit Network Settings --> Select your created VPC insted of default one
            --> Subnet is auto selected --> Auto-assign public IP ENABLE
            --> New Security group --> rdp-anywhere --> Launch
  
 Connect to Server using RDP
 Ping test will show if its connected to internet or not.
        

 You have created a Virtual Private Cloud and tested it successfully.
