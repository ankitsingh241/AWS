    This is our third lab.

    We will learn how to add volume before and after creating a Windows Server.

    Adding volume before launching Windows instance.

    Step 1 : EC2 --> OS or AMI - Windows --> Instance type - t2.micro
             Key pair --> Network Setting --> Configure storage - add new volume 
    
    Step 2 : Free tier eligible can get up to 30 GB of EBS General Purpose (SSD) 
             or Magnetic storage.


    Now you have already two volume lets say 30GB of Root vol. and 20GB of EBS volume.
    But after launching instance you want to add another voulume according to your requirment.


    Adding volume after launching Windows instance.

    Step 1 : Click on running instance --> Go to Volumes --> create voulme -->
             Volume type - Size - click on Create.

             Other two volumes are in use but this one will not because its not attched to server.
    
    Step 2 : Select new volume --> Actions --> Attach volume --> select your instance.
             Now, In windows instance
             Go to Server --> Server manager --> Files & Storage Services -->
             Volumes --> Disks --> Click on new volume --> Bring online -->
             click on it again --> New Vol. Wizard --> Next--Name--Drive E--Create.

    Go to my computer, now you have three storage in your Windows server.
    In future you can add more voulume if required.
