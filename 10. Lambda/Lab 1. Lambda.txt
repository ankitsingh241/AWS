              
   This is our first lab of Lambda.
    
   We will learn how to work with Lambda in AWS.

   We will write a code in lambda that whenever anything will be uploaded
   in S3 it will create the items in the DynamoDB table or details of that file.
   
   First we will create a IAM role for that.
      
   Step 1 : IAM --> Roles --> Create --> AWS service
            Common use cases Lambda --> Add permission
            DynamoDB full access --> role name --> create role.

   Step 2 : Now create a Lambda function.
            Go to Lambda --> create function --> Author from scratch
            name --> language --> change default execution role --> use a existing role
            select the role that you have created in IAM --> create function.
   
   Step 3 : Write the code that whenever anything will be uploaded
            in S3 it will create the items in DynamoDB table or details of that file.
            
            Deploy.

   Step 4 : Before adding Trigger we have to make a bucket in S3.

   Step 5 : Add trigger --> S3 --> select bucket --> Add.

   Step 6 : Create a DynamoDB table which is empty.

   Step 7 : Now upload a file in S3 bucket and you will see the details
            of the files will be added in the table of DynamoDB as items.
   

   This is how using Lambda we will automate things in AWS.
