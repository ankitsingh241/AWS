              
   This is our Second lab.
    
   We will create, upload, sync file and delete a S3 bucket using CLI.

   Login to your AWS Management console, go to Storage S3.

   Step 1: Install AWS CLI --> CMD --> aws configure
           it will ask Access key Id and Secret access key.
           Download these key from Security credentials in AWS console.
   
   Step 2: Access key --> Secret access key --> Default region (no need to change)
           Default output format (none)

   Step 3: Now to make a bucket run the following command
           
           aws s3 mb s3://ankitbucket01 (mb = make bucket)

   Step 4: Since your bucket has been created upload some file, to upload follow
           First cd into that file then use command

           aws s3 sync . s3://ankitbucket01 (here dot represents desktop)

   Step 5: Suppose you have deleted a file from your local but that file is in bucket,
           to sync the file from bucket to local use command

           aws s3 sync s3://ankitbucket01 .

   Step 6: Now if you dont have any use of the bucket you can delete by using command

           for empty bucket
           
           aws s3 rb s3://ankitbucket01

           But if the bucket has some object then use
           
           aws s3 rb s3://ankitbucket01 --force

   
   This is how we can make and delete a bucket using CLI.
