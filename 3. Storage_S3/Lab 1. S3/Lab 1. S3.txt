              
   This is our first lab of Storage.
    
   We will create a Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket in AWS.

   Login to your AWS Management console, go to Storage S3.

   
   Step 1 : Write a unique name, select ACL enable and create.
   
   Step 2 : Now lets upload some files in it.
            Upload --> Add files --> upload

   Step 3 : Select object --> Open --> it will open the file in a new tab.
            
   Step 4 : Now copy object URL and paste it in new tab access will be denied.
            
            If you go to Permissions you will see only owner has Read and Write access.
            
            But if you want to read only access to public, then

            Permission --> unselect block all public access --> confirm
            
            select the object --> Actions --> make public using ACL --> make public
 
            Now copy object URL and paste it in new tab and it will show you the content of the file.
            
   Step 5 : To delete the bucket first you have to make it empty then delete.
  
        

   You have created a S3 bucket and uploaded file and made it public successfully.
