              
   This is our third lab of Storage.
    
   We will learn how to Versioning of buckets in AWS.

   Login to your AWS Management console, go to Storage S3.

   
   Step 1 : Write a unique name, select ACL enable and create.
   
   Step 2 : Now lets upload some files in it.
            Upload --> Add files --> upload

   Step 3 : Select object --> Open --> it will open the file in a new tab.
            
   Step 4 : Now copy object URL and paste it in new tab access will be denied.
            
            If you go to Permissions you will see only owner has Read and Write access.
            
            But if you want to read only access to public, then

            Permission --> unselect block all public access --> confirm
            
            select the object --> Actions --> make public using ACL --> make public
 
            Now copy object URL and paste it in new tab and it will show you the content of the file.
            
   Step 5 : Now go to bucket --> Peoperties --> Edit Bucket Versioning Enable.

   Step 6 : Update the uploaded file in your local and upload it again.

   Step 7 : Click on the Object and go to Versions yo will see two files one former and other updated one.
            Refer image Version1.

  
   Suppose someone has deleted the object in your bucket.
           
             How will you retrieve it ? 
   
   Step 8 : After deletion into the bucket you will see SHOW VERSION button click on it.
            It will show both updated and former files.

   Step 9 : Select the file which shows delete marker and delete it again.
            It will be restored in the bucket.
           

   You have created a S3 bucket, uploaded file and made it public at the same time you enable versioning so it can be restored even after deletion.
