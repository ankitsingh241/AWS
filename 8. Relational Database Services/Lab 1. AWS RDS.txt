              
   This is our first lab of Relational Database Services(RDS).
    
   We will learn how to create a Database in AWS.

   Login to your AWS Management console, go to RDS.

   
   Step 1 : create database --> Standard create
            Engine --> MySQL
            Templates --> Free tier
            Settings --> Password
            Instance config --> db.t2.micro
            Storage --> General Purpose SSD --> Disable autoscaling
            Connectivity --> Default --> Public access YES --> Create new security group
            Additional config --> name --> disbale backup
            Create database.

   Step 2 : Security groups --> Edit inbound rule --> add rule -->
            RDP, HTTP, HTTPS --> source ANYWHERE --> Save
   
   Step 3 : Create a linux instance --> select the same security group as RDS has.
           
   Step 4 : Once connected to putty login as ec2-user.
             
            Run these commands
            
            sudo su -
            yum install -y MySQL
            mysql -h endpoint_url -u admin -p db1(database name)
            password - db password

            Now you have connected to mysql so upload your data into database as much as possible.
