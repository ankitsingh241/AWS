              
   This is our first lab of Loadbalancer(LB).
    
   We will learn how to create a loadbalancer in AWS.

   Login to your AWS Management console, go to EC2.

   
   Step 1 : Click on Launch Templates --> launch a windows instance.

   Step 2 : Go to Auto Scaling Groups --> Name --> Select your template --> Next
            Select all subnets --> next --> Attatch a new load balancer(...) --> next -->
            min or max as you like --> next --> review --> launch.

   Step 3 : Attach a new load balancer --> Application --> name --> Internet facing
            --> create a target group --> next.
           
   Step 4 : Now you will see one LB and one Target group has been created.
