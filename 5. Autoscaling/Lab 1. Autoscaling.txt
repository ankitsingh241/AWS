              
   This is our first lab of Autoscaling.
    
   We will learn how to create a Auto Scaling Group in AWS.

   Login to your AWS Management console, go to EC2.

   
   Step 1 : Click on Launch Templates --> launch a windows instance.

   Step 2 : Go to Auto Scaling Groups --> Name --> Select your template --> Next
            Select all subnets --> next --> No load balancer --> next -->
            min or max as you like --> next --> review --> launch.

   Step 3 : Go to EC2 Instance we will see running instance created by Autoscaling group.
           
   Step 4 : Now click on the ASG and go to Automatic scaling 
            There is three type of Automatic Scaling policy : 
                                                             
            1.Dynamic scaling policy
            2.Predeictive scaling policy 
            3.Scheduled actions
         
   Step 5 : We will use Dynamic scaling policy to scale up the server of a given website. 
            There are three type of policy in dynamic : Simple scaling
                                                        Step scaling
                                                        Target tracking
                                                         
   Step 6 : We will learn how to use Target tracking scaling.
            Dynamic scaling --> Target tracking --> Average CPU utilization --> target value (60%)
  
   Step 7 : Once your CPU utilization will go above 60% ASG will create a new instance to as per requirment.
